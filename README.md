# Roguelike
# Git workflow
*Recommended*
1. Clone the repository
2. Stage and commit changes to `main`
3. Push to a new branch like so:
  ```sh
  git push origin main:<branch-name>
  ```

*Alternative*
- **Don't push to main**
- Push to a *branch* of main!
1. Clone
2. Create a spin-off branch of origin/main
3. Stage changes and commit
4. Push to origin, creating the branch.
